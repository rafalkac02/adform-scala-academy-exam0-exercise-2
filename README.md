# 2. Isogram

This is an exercise number 2 from exam conducted after 1st month of Scala Academy at [Adform](https://github.com/adform).

### Task description
Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:
- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
